# Project: Loans Data Analysis 
## by Abdulquadri Aliyu 


## Dataset
> 
In this project I explored loan datasets from Prosper Marketplace Inc. - a California-based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry. The loan data contains 113,937 loans and 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.. More information about Prosper can be found [here](https://www.prosper.com/about). Out of 81 loans variables in this dataset, the aim of this analysis was to focus all data exploration efforts on about about 10-15 of them to provide answers to a few critical questions about:

- Distribution of investors.
- Annual progression of the borrower rates of loans
- Relationship between borrower rate of loans, prosper ratings and customers who are home owners


## Summary of Analysis
> 
At the heart of every analysis is a question. A few critical questions were asked at the start of my analysis and the following process was used to provide answers to these questions. **Click [here](https://github.com/a-aqua/Exploration-and-Analysis-of-Prosper-Loans-Data/blob/master/exploration_template.ipynb) to view my analysis notebook.**
- Data was acquired and imported into notebook environment.
- Data was wrangled through the conventional gathering, assessment and cleaning process.
- Univariate Data Exploration was conducted.
- Bivariate Data Exploration was conducted.
- Multivariate Data Exploration was conducted.


## Summary of Findings

Click [here](https://github.com/a-aqua/Exploration-and-Analysis-of-Prosper-Loans-Data/blob/master/slide_deck_template.ipynb) to view a slide deck of my findings
- **Distribution of investors:** analysis showed that investors gravitate towards sponsoring smaller loan bundles collected by many borrowers over bigger loans collected by fewer borrowers.
- **Yearly progression of the borrower rates:** analysis shows a steady increase in Year-on-Year lending activity. With an exception of a sharp decline in 2008 (possibly due to the financial recession). Since then there has been more Year-on-Year growth recorded. 
- **Do home-owners enjoy lower borrower rates:** analysis suggests that owning a property (home) results in higher loan rating. A higher rating results in a better loan offering at reduced rates.
